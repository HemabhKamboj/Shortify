# ***Shortify***
## ***Faster than 4x***
 Shortify provides summary of the video contents and also generates a shorter version of it by cropping it, depending upon some frames which are chosen 
 using Machine Learning.


## Problem Statement
Watching video lectures before exam day, seems time consuming, and watching hour long videos just to get the essence of a topic is impractical for last minute preparation. Even watching entertainment videos can be dull at times. Repetitive shots, slow narration or even boring and uninteresting stuff can waste huge chunks of our time.   


## Solution
> We propose a solution which will take a video and in short, shorten it for us, while maintaining the essence and information intact.   

We provide a facility in the form of a Web Application where the user can upload the URL to a video and we will extract the important clips from it. Additionally, we aim to provide the user with a text summary in a very succinct manner. 

For instance, you are preparing for an exam but you have very less time, so every minute of your time is valuable. Sitting for hours looking at your screen can be tiring and to be honest VERY BORING. Why waste hours watching it when you can learn it in a few minutes?
